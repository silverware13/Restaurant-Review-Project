		<h2>Restaurant Review Database</h2>
		
		<h3>The problem:</h3>
		<p>With so many sources to find restaurant reviews, that have different rating systems, formats, and biases, it can be difficult to determine the ideal restaurant to go to. 
		One website may rate an establishment as a five-star restaurant, while another site may rate it on a point scale, or some different system. The main problem is that inconsistency between websites does very little to help people decide where to eat.
		In addition, there are multiple options for restaurant rating websites out there. Now a consumer is forced to first decide which website they’d like to use, and then use that to decide which restaurant to eat at. 
		What if restaurant “A” only has reviews on Tripadvisor, and restaurant “B” only has reviews on Eater? 
		If an individual is trying to select between restaurants “A” and “B” this requires them to understand the different formats of the sites and differing grading criteria.</p>
		
		<h3>A brief plan on how we plan to address the aforementioned issues:</h3>
		<p>We will design a site that uses our database to display standardized reviews of restaurants from multiple sources.
		Our database will have standardized ratings and combine ratings from various sources to get an average of restaurant reviews. To standardize the reviews per site, we will have to convert the site’s score into our own scale, which may differ per site. The method for standardization will require research into the site’s own scoring system.
		To obtain the data we will use data sets, such as the ones available from Yelp, and Zomato’s API. We will design software or use software that can format our data as needed.
